#What this repository is:

This repository is for educational purposes and for personal reference 
in learning RSpec gathered from various resources. The core resource included 
is the Udemy course:

Testing Ruby with RSpec: The Complete Guide

I will be including some course notes on my current progress and 
future implementation on the Rails apps I am currently working on.

#The Goal:

The goal is to learn RSpec and Ruby proficiently so that I (and others on the same 
journey as me that decide to follow) can learn to effectively implement 
a TDD - Test Driven Development approach to Software Development. 
This will apply directly to my second Rails project laguna-media-arts and 
further tested in Mission Share Kindness collaborative project.

In my pursuit of a position in Software Development/QA, I encourage 
prospective employers to go through my work and feel free to comment and 
give feedback of any kind. 

I appreciate feedback that will drive me to succeed in getting
hired for a Software Development/QA position. This includes my deployed 
projects as well as my exercises.

#What I have learned so far:

- Testing Pyramid
- Red, Green, Refactor
- Examples, Failures, Errors and Pending Examples
- Describe, It, Expect and Helper methods
- Let syntax for memoiazition and refactoring test code, 
note* that let! resembles the behavior future implementation on the Rails apps I am currently working on. of a 'before' method
- Custom Error Messages
- Nested describe blocks for better readability running tests
- Before and After example and context
- Nested Hooks for more simple, elegant test code without duplication
- Multi-Context Hooks and overwriting 'let' for different contexts
- Implicit Subject for Hashes
- Using described_class helper to only reference the class under test
- One-liner syntax using is_expected method for subject
- Using shared_examples method and include_examples to DRY up test code
- Using shared_context method and include_context for reuse accross multiple examples
- Negative assertion using the not_to method
- Asserting values vs data types with eq and eql
- Equality vs identity for objects using equal/be
- Comparison matchers using Ruby built-in operators
- Basic Ruby authenticator using a hash, arrary, conditionals and user input
- Using RSpec predicate matchers for predicate methods in Ruby
- Using the all() matcher method for passing predicate methods or conditions into it
- Interacting with hashes using user input, loops and string interpolation
- Assert truthy, falsy and explicit nil values with the be matcher method
- Change matcher to assert changes in object state
- Contain exactly matcher to assert exact elements within an array
- Start and end with matchers that assert beginning and end objects
- Have attributes matcher to assert attributes given to objects
- Include matcher for a variety of given values to match object(s) tested
