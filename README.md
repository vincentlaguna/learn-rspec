README

#What this repository is:

This repository is for educational purposes and for personal reference 
in learning RSpec gathered from various resources. The core resource included 
is the Udemy course:

Testing Ruby with RSpec: The Complete Guide

I will be including some course notes on my current progress and 
future implementation on the Rails apps I am currently working on.

#The Goal:

The goal is to learn RSpec proficiently so that I (and others on the same 
journey as me that decide to follow) can learn to effectively implement 
a TDD - Test Driven Development approach to Software Development. 
This will apply directly to my second Rails project laguna-media-arts and 
further tested in Mission Share Kindness collaborative project.

In my pursuit of a position in Software Development/QA, I encourage 
prospective employers to go through my work and feel free to comment and 
give feedback of any kind. 

I appreciate feedback that will drive me to succeed in getting
hired for a Software Development/QA position. This includes my deployed 
projects as well as my exercises.

#What I have learned so far:

- Testing Pyramid
- Red, Green, Refactor
- Examples, Failures, Errors and Pending Examples
- Describe, It, Expect and Helper methods
- Let syntax for memoiazition and refactoring test code, 
note* that let! resembles the behaviour of a 'before' method
- Custom Error Messages
- Nested describe blocks for better readability running tests
- Before and After example and context
- Nested Hooks for more simple, elegant test code without duplication
- Multi-Context Hooks and overwriting 'let' for different contexts
-
